# Car Linear Regression in R
This project performs a simple linear regression analysis using the built-in `mtcars` dataset in R. The goal is to predict a car’s fuel efficiency (measured in **miles per gallon**, `mpg`) based on its **horsepower** (`hp`).
## Project Summary
- Dataset: `mtcars` (R built-in)
- Model Used: Simple linear regression
- Formula: `mpg = 30.10 - 0.068 * hp`
- R² value: 0.60
- p-value (hp): < 0.001 (statistically significant)
## Visualisations
- Scatter plot of MPG vs HP with regression line
- Residual plot to check model fit
## Files
- `Car_Linear_Regression.R`: R script for data analysis
- `Car Linear Regression.pdf`: Knit report with summary and visuals
## Future Ideas
- Add more predictors (e.g., weight, number of cylinders)
- Try multiple regression or polynomial regression
- Explore model diagnostics
